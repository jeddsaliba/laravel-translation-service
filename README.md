# Translation Service

This Laravel module provides an API for managing translations, including support for multiple locales and tagging.
It includes functionality for listing, creating, updating, and deleting translations, with optional filtering by key and tags.

## Features
- **List translations** by locale, with optional filtering by key and tags.

cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Configure the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file:
